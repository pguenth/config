Ranger setup:

* search with plocate/fzk:
see files in .config/ranger
-> there are custom commands defined for calling mlocate/plocate and fzk,
where files are queried with *locate and are filtered with fzk.
the commands are binded to ctrl+f and ctrl+g in rc.confj

the mlocate-db config in /etc/updatedb.conf is modified to include /mnt
the updatedb-timer is modified with systemctl edit to run every five minutes
the updatedb-service is modified with systemctl edit to also update the plocate database

* recent files with fasd:
recent files/directories are stored on every cd or file open action in ranger
with fasd (see plugin/plugin_fasd_log.py).

There is a command :fasd to query the directories and open the best match

* archives browsing with avfs:
installed avfs and set up some commands (see avfs_* in commands.py)
rc.conf keymap for <RIGHT> (and therefore j) modified to recognize archive suffixes and automatically use those commands

* keymap changes
v -> visual mode
V -> visual mode unselect
b -> invert selection
t -> new tab
T -> tag files
X -> extract archive
C -> compress files
^F -> find plocate fzk
^G -> find only fzk (may be slower, but only one step)
